Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and XAI 
Abstract: Advances in supporting technology, particularly in big  data and machine learning, have given predictive analytics a lot of  attention in recent years. The healthcare sector has recently seen the  application of disease prediction. This project has been 
demonstrated the prediction of a heart attack among many others.  Heart disease, more commonly referred to as cardiovascular  disease, is a group of conditions that affect the heart and has  emerged as the world's leading cause of death in recent decades. It  connects a slew of heart disease risk factors to the urgent need for  precise, dependable, and practical methods for early diagnosis and  management. Data mining is a common method for analyzing a lot  of data in the healthcare industry because it is difficult to predict  cardiac disease. To avoid the risks associated with it and to inform  the patient well in advance, the procedure must be automated. Data  mining methods like XG-Boost , Logistic Regression, Decision  tree, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, K-neighbors  classifier, and Naive Bayes can be used to identify heart diseases.  We have demonstrated through this project that, when it comes to  predicting heart attacks, XG-BOOST and KNN performs better  than the other machine learning models mentioned above.  Consequently, the performance of several machine learning  algorithms is compared in this paper. The dataset's features play a  crucial role in any kind of prediction. The final prediction can be  influenced positively or negatively by features. We have got a  95.60% accuracy rate by using KNN algorithm and used  explainable AI technique to explain the reason of heart disease. The  XAI methods can be used to show how important features are. The  predictability of the model is also interpreted using a new method  in this paper. By utilizing the XAI technique LIME with the  assistance of the idea of a black box, this exploration leads the  KNN calculations expectation
